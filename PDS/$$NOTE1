Hi Sam,

I am sending an XMIT unloaded PDS with changed and added members
for FILE563 (COBOL) most notably the documentation member,
$$README.

In the process of creating the documentation member, I found a
number of programs that are incorrect, incomplete, lack pieces
and parts necessary for compilation, linkedit, or execution, and
other matters that render them useless clutter. I have deleted
these members from my personal copy of FILE563. The deleted
members are: CALLCBLT, CALLCNYY, CALLDB2A, CALLGRPC, CALLGTDS,
CALLGTDT, CALLGTD3, CALLMLCK, CALLPASS, CALLRNMF, CALLSNAP,
CALLSVDA, COBLMSGS, COBVMAIN, COB2RES, COPYERRS, COPYFILE,
C1UEXT02, DYNAMSB1, ERRMSG, FILLBLOW, MCTFSEQ, MULTPROG,
MULTTEST, RANDXREF, RECDEF, RZZMIX, SRTSVC99, STARTREK, TGTCOBV,
TSTGNLDT, TWOPROG, WRTVRBL, and XFOOT.

I hope to have a good $$README and trash list for the JCL file,
FILE560 next, but it probably won't be ready until next week.

Have a fun weekend,

Dick
