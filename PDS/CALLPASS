000400*REMARKS. CALLS ANOTHER COBOL PROGRAM PASSING AN ARGUMENT FIELD
000410*         CONTAINED IN ITS WORKING-STORAGE SECTION. WHEN COMPILED
000420*         WITH RENT,DATA(31), THE WORKING STORAGE WILL BE GOTTEN
000430*         DYNAMICALLY FROM ABOVE THE LINE. PURPOSE OF THIS PROGRAM
000440*         IS TO TEST THE PROBLEMS (IF ANY) CAUSED BY USE OF THIS
000450*         SCENARIO IN CALLS BETWEEN AMODE=31 AND AMODE=24 COBOL
000460*         PROGRAMS. A S0C7 ABEND IS CREATED FOLLOWING RETURN FROM
000470*         RECEIVER IN ORDER TO PRODUCE A DUMP.
